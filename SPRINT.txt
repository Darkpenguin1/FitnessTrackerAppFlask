Just a quick file of everything I want to do within a "sprint" just trying to simulate the real world even though I am far from that 

curr date = 7/17/2024


Everything I want to accomplish this "Sprint"

1 week: Implement crud functionality to the admin page. To create, update, delete users from the db

Week one summary:
    I implemented CRUD functionality for exercises within the db and CRUD functionality without the built in admin portal from flask

2 week: Figure out the scope of my project ie what I exactly want it to do logic wise
curr date = 7/24/24

For example when Users edit their workout plans do i associate the edit with the editing the cycle or length or each workout day, adding/deleting exercises
from each workout day 

In my mind I want this sort of layout

PPL SPLIT PLAN 
        Push                        Pull                           Legs
        Exercise list:              Exercise list:                 Exercise list:
            stuff....                   stuff...                        stuff....


In this example I want stuff to be the thing being edited the exercises on each workout day basically the cycle day!
